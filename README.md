The goal is to train cooperative agents using Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO) while introducing Adversarial Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (AMARL) to create opposing agents. 
Additionally, Meta-Learning for Multi-Agent Adaptation and Natural Language Communication Between Agents are incorporated to enhance adaptability and strategic decision-making.  

## **Key Features**  
- **Custom Fireboy & Watergirl Environment**: Implements a grid-based environment with physics-based interactions.  
- **Cooperative Learning (MAPPO)**: Trains Fireboy and Watergirl to coordinate efficiently.  
- **Adversarial Learning (AMARL)**: Introduces competing agents to challenge cooperation strategies.  
- **Meta-Learning for Adaptation**: Enhances agent adaptability across different levels.  
- **Natural Language Communication**: Enables agents to exchange textual messages for coordination.
